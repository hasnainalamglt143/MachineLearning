# 📉 Gradient Descent  in Python

This project demonstrates **Gradient Descent** for **Linear Regression** using both:
- A single input feature (univariate)
- Multiple input features (multivariate)

The implementation includes:
- Manual weight updates using gradient descent
- Visualization of the cost function convergence
- Prediction and line fitting visualization (for 1D case)

---

## 📌 Features

✅ Gradient Descent for **one feature (x → y)**  
✅ Gradient Descent for **multiple features (x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ → y)**  
✅ Cost function (MSE) visualization  
✅ Prediction vs Ground Truth comparison  
✅ Easy to tweak learning rate, epochs, and dataset

## 🔧 Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Required libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
pip install sklearn
